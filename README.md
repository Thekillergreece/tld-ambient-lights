# Ambient lights mod
This mod aims to modify the default lightning for interiors with windows, making them brighter so you don't need a light source during midday to move around, and also more reflective of what's happening outside (time of day, weather, and sun position).
These lights are just ambiental and not "real" lights, so to craft or do things at night you will still need a lightsource just like in the base game.

## Main Features
* Lighting intensity (how bright the light is), range (how far the light reaches) and color changes depending of what's happening outside.
* Clear and light cloudy weathers will have a warmer color.
* Foggy weathers are greenish, blizzards are more dark blue, and overcast weathers are more gray-ish.
* Makes most interiors brighter by default.
* Mod options to change default intensity and range even mid-game.
* Option to make nights as dark as the base game, or even brighter than the mod's default.
* Window orientations. For example, with clear weather during dawn, the east side of a place will be brighter and will have a warmer color than the west side.
* Option to change default intensity of Aurora powered lights.

## Installation
* If you haven't already done so, install the [Mod Loader](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller) by **zeobviouslyfakeacc** and patch your game.
* You should have [ModSettings](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModSettings/releases/tag/v1.1) by **zeo** installed in order to be able to change the mod's default options. Download the .dll and put it in your mods folder.
* Head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/Xpazeman/tld-ambient-lights/releases/) page and download Ambient_Lights_vX.X.zip
* Unzip it and move AmbientLights.dll and the ambient-lights folder into your mods directory (it's in <path_to_TheLongDark_installation_folder>/mods ), it should look like this (of course you might have more mods installed):

## Editing the mod's lighting
Since AmbientLights is based on JSON files, it isn't complicated to edit the mod's default lighting values.
Inside the ambient-lights folder there are three types of files: scene_*, global_sets, and global_periods.

* global_periods is used to define on what period we are so global_sets can use that data. New periods can be added, but they need to be added to global_sets as well.
* global_sets is used to define the lighting for each period, weather and orientation.
* scene_* are the files where the windows are defined, as well as the multipliers for range and intensity for that particular scene. In this file, the default sets can also be overriden. Inside the "periods" object we can use the same structure as in global_sets.json
